### Description
This project is a full YuGiOh game written in Java. The graphics part of the project is written in JavaFX.
This project includes most of the features of any usual YuGiOh game including DeckCreator, Shop, OnlinePlay, ...
Two of the most noticeable features of this game include:

1. CardCreatorMenu: It is possible to create any card with any effects you want. More effects result in higher price of the card.

2. Interactive gameplay with AI: The gameplay of this project is designed on a board for player vs player games, whereas in the AI gameplay, interactive use of cards and more dueling actions are also implemented.

### Running
As this program in written in server-client architecture, you must first run the Main.java in src/main/java/project/server/Main.java
and then, run the MainView.java in src/main/java/project/client/view/MainView.java
Running the latter program creates a client for playing the game. You can run this again to login as another client and let the two clients play with eachother.
It is also possible to play with the AI.

The latest update of the program is accessible from the main branch of this repository.
